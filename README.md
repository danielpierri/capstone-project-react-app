# Capstone Project

As part of conclusion of the Advanced React module from the Scrimba's The Frontend Developer Career Path course,
I did this very simple online store simulation that has many React JS fundamentals as:
- useContext;
- useState;
- useRef;
- useEffect;
- BrowserRouter;
- Custom Hooks;
- Prop-Types;
- Etc..
